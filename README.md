# Quiz about games made with ThreeJS
This is a simple 3D quiz game. It took me a while to do it, but I think it went quite nice. To get random questions I used API from [opentdb.com](https://opentdb.com/).
I don't own models, I've taken them from [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/features/free-3d-models).
This [tool](https://sbtron.github.io/makeglb/) helped me a lot with packing
GLTF to GLB. It was meant to be an online game, but I'm not an author of the server part (you can play with your friend [here](http://amogus-quiz.herokuapp.com/)).
